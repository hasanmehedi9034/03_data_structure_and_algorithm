/*
    ------ Array Limition -------
    1. Static or fixed number of element can sotred into the arrya, example: you declare an array ar[10], you can not keep into the array over 10 element. otherwise linked list have no limit to keep element.

    2. waste of memory. suppose you deaclare an array ar[10] but you stored only 2 element into the array then other 8 element is waste of memory, but linked list is not so. linked dont waste memoryl

    3. array element adding and deletion process is so hard, otherwise elemenet insert into linked list any position is very easy

    4. array element stay in sequentially in the memory. that is not good sometimes, but linked list element is stay sequentially they ar linked by address with each other.
